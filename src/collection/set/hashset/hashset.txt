HashSet
~~~~~~~~~~~

// HashSet class implements the Set interface
// No guarantee is made as to the iteration order of the hash sets which means that the 
// class does not guarantee the constant order of elements over time.
// Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in the same order. 
// NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
// As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
