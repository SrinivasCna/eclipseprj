Queue
~~~~~~~~

// Queue Data Structure
// Queue is defined as a linear data structure which is open at both ends.
// Queue is based on the FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT (FIFO) Principle.
// First entry in queue is called the front (head) of the queue.
// Recent entry in queue is called the rear (tail) of the queue.
// Enqueue - process of adding recent entry in queue.
// Dequeue - process of removing first entry from the queue.

// Features of Queue:
// Queue can handle multiple data
// We can access both ends of Queue.
// Queue is fast and flexible.
