Linked List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LinkedList class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure.
LinkedList is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored 
in continuous locations.
Every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
The elements are linked using pointers and addresses.
Each element is known as a node.

Nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from the head and 
follow through the link to reach a node we wish to access.
