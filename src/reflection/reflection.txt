Reflection API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/*
 * Java Reflection API
 * Java's Reflection API allows us to write a program that can look at itself
 * and even it can change itself while running.
 * 
 * Reflection is an API that is used to examine or modify the behavior of 
 * methods, classes, and interfaces at runtime.
 * 
 * The required classes for reflection are provided under 
 * java.lang.reflect package which is essential in order to 
 * understand reflection.
 * 
 * Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs 
 * and also the methods of that class that can be executed by using the object.
 * 
 * Through reflection, we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the 
 * access specifier used with them.
 * 
 * Reflection can be used to get information about class, constructors, and methods as 
 * depicted below:
 * 
 * Class
 * The getClass() method is used to get the name of the class to which
 *  an object belongs.
 * 
 * Constructors
 * The getConstructors() method is used to get the public constructors of the 
 * class to which an object belongs.
 * 
 * Methods
 * The getMethods() method is used to get the public methods of the class to 
 * which an object belongs.
