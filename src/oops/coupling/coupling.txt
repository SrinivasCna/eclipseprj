Tight Coupling and Loose Coupling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why is coupling important ?

Coupling is important everywhere

An engine is tightly coupled to Car.
A wheel is loosely coupled to a Car
You can take a laptop anywhere you go.
A Desktop, on the other hand, is a little bit more difficult to move.

Coupling is even more important in building great software.
Only thing constant in technology is change.  
Business requirements change.
Frameworks change.
Code changes.
We want Loose Coupling as much as possible.
We want to make functional changes with as less code changes is possible.

Java Interfaces help us to achieve Loose Coupling.
