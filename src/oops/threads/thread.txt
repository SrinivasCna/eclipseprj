Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thread is a line of execution within a program. Each program can have
multiple associated threads.
 
Threads are the smallest unit of process. Threads have separate paths of
execution. Threads use shared memory but they act independently hence if
there is an exception in threads that do not affect the working of other
threads despite them sharing the same memory. Threads are lightweight
subprocess.

Java provides a thread class that has various method calls in order to manage
the behavior of threads by providing constructors and methods to perform
operations on threads.
 
There are two ways to start a new Thread. 1. By extending Thread class - sub
class of Thread. 2. By implementing Runnable interface.
 
There is no need of subclassing a Thread when a task can be done by
overriding only run() method of Runnable interface.
